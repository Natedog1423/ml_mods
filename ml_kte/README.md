# Kinect Tracking Extension

MelonLoader mod for VRChat that brings Kinect tracking.  
Supports Kinect for XBox One / Kinect 2 for Windows and Kinect for XBox 360.

# Installation
* Install [latest MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)
* Install [latest VRChatUtilityKit](https://github.com/SleepyVRC/Mods)
* **Optional:** Install [latest UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)
* Get [latest release DLL](../../../releases/latest)
* Put `ml_kte.dll` in `Mods` folder of game

# Usage
Check self-explanatory mod settings in UIExpansionKit's mods settings tab.

# Notes
* Avatars that have unproportional skeleton to your real life skeleton can be visually distorted (flipped hips, bent legs). Solution is in progress. 
* Designed for desktop usage, can't be used for VR because of recent changes in VRChat's internal tracking hierarchy. Instead use SteamVR drivers that emulate trackers based on data from Kinect.
* Usage of mods breaks ToS of VRChat and can lead to ban. Use at your own risk.
