# Installation
* Install [latest MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)
* Install [latest UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)
* Install [latest VRChatUtilityKit](https://github.com/SleepyVRC/Mods)
* Get [latest release DLL](../../../releases/latest)
* Put `ml_alg.dll` in `Mods` folder of game

# Usage
* Select player in quick menu.
* Press `Allow limbs manipulation` in UIExpansionKit quick menu.

After that selected player can:
* Move you around by grabbing (fist gesture) around your avatar head bone
* Manipulate your hips, hands and legs

Also, check self-explanatory mod settings in UIExpansionKit's mods settings tab.

# Notes
* Early [IKTweaks](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) support, use recalibration to reset manipulated bones.
* You can't be picked up in worlds that don't allow risky functions.
* Shame on you for using it in ERP.
* Usage of mods breaks ToS of VRChat and can lead to ban. Use at your own risk.
